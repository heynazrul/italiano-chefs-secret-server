    "bio": " Born on February 21, 1947, Lidia Matticchio Bastianich’s early years were marked by the tumult in Europe after World War II. Lidia’s birthplace, Pola, was made a part of Yugoslavia on February 10, 1947, a mere eleven days before she was born. Her family faced hardship during the Communist regime in Yugoslavia. In 1956, her father, Vittorio, sent Lidia, her mother, and brother to Trieste, Italy under the guise of visiting relatives. The Matticchio family remained in Trieste, and were joined by her father shortly thereafter.",
